Purpose
=======

This website seeks to pull together a variety of spatial data resources to help illustrate the karst geology of southwestern wisconsin, and provide tools for citizens to explore and participate in groundwater conservation.

Background
==========

Initial pieces of this project were funded by two grants from [Save The Hills Alliance](https://wisair.wordpress.com/about-stha/), in 2016 and 2017. [Crawford Stewardship Project](https://crawfordstewardship.org) (CSP) worked with [Legion GIS](https://legiongis.com) to explore new, volunteer-driven methods for mapping karst features in Crawford County, Wisconsin. Our objective was to combine open data, geospatial analysis, and basic web tools to generate new karst-related information through citizen engagement.

Out of these efforts, and with further investment from the CSP in subsequent years, we have created this website, _Karstology_ to disseminate some of the data created in the project, and to hold and display new geospatial datasets related to karst geology as they become available.
