Why use volunteers?
===================

Upon taking stock of the data that we had available, and the resources we could put toward analyzing it, we came up with three different activities that would each improve our karst-related data through citizen involvement. Not only did this allow us to create new datasets that could be used in further spatial analysis, but it also provided a way for Crawford county residents to engage in the process.

Some `original content </about/csp/index.html>`_ related to these efforts is still available, but more detailed writeups can be found below.
