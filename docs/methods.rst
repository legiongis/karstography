Generating Sinks from LIDAR
===========================

Our `Sinkhole Methodology Report <_static/files/Sinkhole_Methodology_Report.pdf>`_ by Brendan Heberlein is a thorough step-through guide describing how we used various open source GIS packages to generate sink locations across all of Crawford County from LIDAR-derived elevation data.

Citizen Participation
=====================

Upon taking stock of the data that we had available, and the resources we could put toward analyzing it, we came up with three different activities that would each improve our karst-related data through citizen participation. Not only did this allow us to create new datasets that could be used in further spatial analysis, but it also provided a way for Crawford county residents to engage in the process.

Some `original content </about/csp/index.html>`_ related to these efforts is still available, but more detailed writeups can be found in the following pages.
